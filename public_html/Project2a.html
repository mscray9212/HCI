<h1><b><p>About SkwiuFarms! (Q&A):</p></b></h1>

<p><b>1.) Describe the organization: Is it a community, e.g., slashdot.org, a business, a non-profit group, etc. 
What are its goals and objectives and what services does it provide.</p></b>

Skwiu Farms is a future non profit 501(c)3 organization that is focused on enriching local communities.through the
creation of local cooperative markets based in high quality, free-range poultry, and organically produce grown 
locally. SkwiuFarms will strictly adhere to a no synthetics in the garden policy, a non GMO policy, and also 
focuses on bringing foods of the native, indigenous Americans to the people in communities adjacent to our projects.
SkwiuFarms will implement a hands on philosophy for education and outreach, bringing the best of locally grown 
exotics and natives for a bio-diverse diet from our welcoming community.

<p><b>2.) Describe the projected user community. 
What are their demographics: age, sex, education levels, computer literacy, interests, etc.</p></b>

SkwiuFarms will be located close to the Piedmont and Mountainside area in North Carolina, consisting of many diverse groups of
people from: Permaculture designers, students, apprentices, plant enthusiasts, and artists (hopefully comprised of all gender
and age groups). The unifying force originates in a shared common interest, which is the common interest to all people; that 
is, to have flourishing, and abundant food growing nearby to ensure our healthfulness and prosperity. This organization will 
strive to provide a mutually beneficial system for the soil microbes and people, and provide carbon sequestration from the 
atmosphere. Some known exotic foods will be utilized, with a primary focus on maintaining a 60% minimum on native plant species. 
Sections of SkwiuFarms are allotted for the conservation of native plants, and restoring the populations of native, and exotic, 
endangered plants. This organization will expect and openly welcome scientific researchers who want to study these plants, 
the soil, and videographers or artists who want to document our experiences. Regardless of age, there should be productive ways 
to work, teach, and share.

<p><b>3.) What are the users trying to learn and/or accomplish at the web site? What are their goals and objectives. 
How will they accomplish these? What tasks do they have and what actions will they take to accomplish these?<p></b>
SkwiuFarms will be a platform through which people can understand more about what we do, or who wish to contact our organization to 
arrange for accommodations for those staying or visiting. We hope that users will visit our links for our data, and suggest exotic 
plants for conservation, as well as native plants (that perhaps we've missed or not gotten to yet), so that we have an easier time 
keeping open documentation of our progress. We will be using the Google Drive, for most of our documents, and therefore need only 
the capability to cross platform the links from our Google Drive onto the page, either displayed, or linked to. We will be keeping 
live documentation on the Internet of our inventory, growing and in seed, as well as notes about the growing progress, any pitfalls, 
and easy growing species that should be noted, with progress on the account of restoration of endangered species' populations.
