<h2><br>Description of the JCC</h2></br>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 5em;">
<p><b>1.) Describe the organization: Is it a community, e.g., slashdot.org, a business, a non-profit group, etc. 
What are its goals and objectives and what services does it provide.</p></b><br>

<p> The Japanese Cultural Center (JCC) will be an educational outlet for individuals in the Midtown area of Atlanta (opening July, 2016). The objective for this center is to enlighten others to Japanese culture. Currently, the JCC is expected to provide the following services: a large walk-in model of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, a walk-in model of a Japanese temple, Japanese garden, 'museum-like' displays of traditional garments and crafts, and a gift shop for visitors to purchase souvenirs. Both walk-in models will have a guide to discuss the traditions and structure behind the designs.<p><br>

<p><b>2.) Describe the projected user community. 
What are their demographics: age, sex, education levels, computer literacy, interests, etc.</p></b><br>

<p> The projected user community of the JCC will be comprised of culture and art enthusiasts. The organization should appeal to all races but will likely attract more Japanese-Americans or others individuals with Asian descent. The organization will strive to provide something for everyone (whether it serves as a home away from home or an introduction to a rich, multi-layered and complex, nation). <p><br>

<p><b>3.) What are the users trying to learn and/or accomplish at the web site? What are their goals and objectives. 
How will they accomplish these? What tasks do they have and what actions will they take to accomplish these?<p></b><br>

<p> A typical user will be trying to learn what the JCC has to offer by visiting the website. Other user intentions might include: purchasing a ticket, figuring out what items the souvenir shop has to offer, or finding contact information and operation hours. By taking a virtual tour of the facility, users can experience any areas that do not require admission. Any user wishing to make a purchase can do so by utilizing a third-party application that will be implemented into the site. The souvenir shop and contact information will also receive a section on the site to display all availability. The JCC website will display hours and days (particularly which holidays the JCC will be closed) of operation on the homepage.<p><br>
